Test project to play around with Godot Engine because I saw a demo on twitch by [Ladybenko](https://www.twitch.tv/ladybenko) and wanted to try making a simple 2D test game.  
Kudos to her, because it was really cool attending her talk.

I'm not planning on finishing this or anything, just want to see the basic things that godot can do.

I included the MIT license because is the one Godot uses.

It looks like this:
